this is some of the very first java code that I have ever written. It uses 9 classes, each 
with it’s own purpose to preform some type of calculation. The Main method is inside 
Project1.java, the program uses a menu to select which calculation to run. user input is 
taken from UserInput.java. 

to run the jar file in terminal use this line 
java -jar cs111hw1.jar
