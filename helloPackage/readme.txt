My first java package !!!

The important thing to remember is to compile and run the classes from outside of the 
packages. 

		$ cd source 
		$ javac -d ../classes helloPac/hello.java
	
	once compiled navigate to classes directory. 
	
		$ cd .. 
		$ cd classes 
	
	then from the classes directory run the program 
		
		$ java helloPac/hello
