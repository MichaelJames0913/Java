This is some of the very first java code that I have ever written. It uses 9 classes, each 
with itâ€™s own purpose to preform some type of calculation. The Main method is inside 
Project1.java, the program uses a menu to select which calculation to run. User input is 
taken from UserInput.java.

		$ cd src 
		$ javac -d ../classes project1/Project1.java
	
	once compiled navigate to classes directory. 
	
		$ cd .. 
		$ cd classes 
	
	then from the classes directory run the program 
		
		$ java project1/Project1
