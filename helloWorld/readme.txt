My first java Program !!!

This is not my very first hello world, but what is important about this version is the 	
organization in the directory, the source file is separate from the class file. A way to 
do this is to use this line in the terminal. 
	
	javac -d ../classes hello.java
	
then from the class file run the program 

	java hello
